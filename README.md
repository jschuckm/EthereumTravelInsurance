# Ethereum Travel Insurance Smart Contract
This is a smart contract project for the Distributed Systems class I took in Spring of 2021. This contract is a travel insurance policy and a user sends money to the contract in order to purchase travel insurance. And if their flight is cancelled the insurer pays the amount according to the policy to the user.
